Basic forms of textual data visualization (lexical dispersion and frequency plots). Text modelling (dictionaries, text scaling, statistical topic modeling, structural topic modeling). Advanced topics: elements of scraping (html, regex, working with APIs); mention of Beyond Bag-of-Words: POS tagging and Word Embeddings (Word2vec).
