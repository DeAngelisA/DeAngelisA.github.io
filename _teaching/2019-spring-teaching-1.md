The purpose of the seminar is to facilitate the task of students that are keen on developing an empirical project in their Master theses. This seminar is designed to fill the gap between the studentsâ€™ final works and the classic methods seminars, while offering a service to the scientific community to contrast the replication crisis, by double-checking and re-testing published scientific evidence.
