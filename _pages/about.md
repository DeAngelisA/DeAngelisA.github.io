Welcome! I am a political scientist studying public opinion formation in the digital age. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/staff/andrea-de-angelis-msc/). Starting from September 2022, I will be an SNF-Ambizione Fellow at the University of Zurich to investigate how political misinformation spreads in the digital age. I received the Ph.D. in Political and Social Sciences from the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/home) and I was formerly visiting Junior Scholar at Nuffield College, Oxford University, and Fulbright-Schuman visiting scholar at New York University.  
I am co-initiator of the Lucerne Master in Computational Social Science, [LUMACSS](https://www.unilu.ch/en/study/study-programmes/masters-degrees/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/lucerne-master-in-computational-social-sciences-lumacss/) and [Associate Editor](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/892213/overview) at Frontiers in Political Science. 

My research lies at the intersection of political methodology, computational social sciences and comparative political behavior and was published on *Comparative political Studies*, *Political Communication*, and *West European Politics* among other outlets. Links and pre-prints of my contributions are available in the [Publications](https://deangelisa.github.io/publications/) section. Some of my current projects involve: building experiments with recommendation algorithms to study their effect on public opinion formation; measuring media consumption through smartphone data; investigating the connection between individual cognitive styles and political misinformation; using Bayesian ideal point estimation to model voters' perceptual bias; using psychometrics algorithms to generate fully-automated Voting Advice Applications.  

I am a passionate teacher in statistics, quantitative research methods and computational social science techniques, and a [certified RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) tidyverse instructor. I am keeping a running list of my teaching [at this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lgZFwmryGN5Bnr1jvxrEKB4W0sXWN26OH1xU_cDmWTQ/edit?usp=sharing) with *syllabi* and evaluations. I am happy to share teaching materials upon request. 

I have recently edited a [special issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/16048/political-misinformation-in-the-digital-age-during-a-pandemic-partisanship-propaganda-and-democratic) titled "Political Misinformation in the Digital Age during a Pandemic: Partisanship, Propaganda, and Democratic Decision-making", at Frontiers in Political Science. All papers are open access and an e-book will soon be released. 

My monograph "Leaders without Partisans: Dealignment, Media Change, and the Personalization of Politics", co-authored with Diego Garzia and Frederico Ferreira da Silva and forthcoming at ECPR Press, can be pre-ordered on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-without-Partisans-Dealignment-Personalization/dp/1538156768).
