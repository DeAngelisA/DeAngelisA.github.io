Welcome to my homepage!

I am senior researcher and lecturer in political science at the University of Lucerne. I received my PhD in Political Science at the European University Institute. Formerly I was visiting Junior Scholar at Nuffield College, Oxford, and Fulbright-Schuman visiting scholar at New York University. I also obtained a M.Sc. in Economic and Social Sciences at Bocconi University and a M.Sc. in Comparative and European Politics at University of Siena.

My research lies at the intersection of political methodology and comparative political behavior.
Some of my current projects involve: focusing on the application of Finite Mixture Models to voting models in order to uncover voters' latent heterogeneity; adapting word scaling techniques to detect media capture; using dynamic topic modeling to study the evolution of political discourse of parties and movements; using psychometrics algorithms to generate fully-automated Voting Advice Applications.

In my dissertation, I show how the subjectivity of voters' perceptions can bias our measures of parties’ positions on latent scales such as the left-right ideology and the position towards EU integration. Then, I implement a two-stage Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey scaling model to produce meaningfully comparable latent scores (ideal points) of voters and party positions and compute the party systems’ polarisation indices. Finally, I adopt these new measures to systematically study voters’ electoral availability in the 27 EU countries. Results show that electoral competition in contemporary Europe is no longer structured along the traditional class cleavage, with two opposing blocks of left and center-right parties competing on an underlying economic/cultural left-right dimension. Rather, the confrontation is taking place between two blocks of mainstream and challenger parties divided on a new integration/demarcation cleavage.
