I am Postdoctoral Researcher and Lecturer in Political Science at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/staff/andrea-de-angelis-msc/). I am also co-initiator of the Lucerne Master in Computational Social Science, [LUMACSS](https://www.unilu.ch/en/study/study-programmes/masters-degrees/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/lucerne-master-in-computational-social-sciences-lumacss/), researcher at the MICAP project (Media, Information Consumption, and Politics) financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation, [Associate Editor](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/892213/overview) at Frontiers in Political Science (Political Participation), and [certified RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) tidyverse instructor. I received the Ph.D. in Political and Social Sciences from the European University Institute. Formerly I was visiting Junior Scholar at Nuffield College, Oxford University, and Fulbright-Schuman visiting scholar at New York University. I obtained an M.Sc. in Economic and Social Sciences at Bocconi University and an M.Sc. in Comparative and European Politics at the University of Siena.

My research lies at the intersection of political methodology and comparative political behavior. Links and pre-prints of my contributions are available in the [Publications](https://deangelisa.github.io/publications/) section. Some of my current projects involve: measuring media consumption through smartphone data, investigating the connection between individual cognitive styles and political misinformation, using Bayesian ideal point estimation to model voters' perceptual bias; using Finite Mixture Models in electoral research to uncover voters' latent heterogeneity; using psychometrics algorithms to generate fully-automated Voting Advice Applications.

I have recently edited a special issue on ["Political Misinformation in the Digital Age during a Pandemic: Partisanship, Propaganda, and Democratic Decision-making"](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/16048/political-misinformation-in-the-digital-age-during-a-pandemic-partisanship-propaganda-and-democratic) at Frontiers in Political Science. All papers are Open Access! An e-book will be soon released. 

My monograph "Leaders without Partisans: Dealignment, Media Change, and the Personalization of Politics", co-authored with Diego Garzia and Frederico Ferreira da Silva and forthcoming at ECPR Press, can be pre-ordered on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-without-Partisans-Dealignment-Personalization/dp/1538156768).
