I am Senior Researcher and Lecturer in Political Science at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/staff/andrea-de-angelis-msc/). I am also Co-Initiator of the Lucerne Master in Computational Social Science, [LUMACSS](https://www.unilu.ch/studium/studienangebot/master/kultur-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/lucerne-master-in-computational-social-sciences-lumacss/), and post-doctoral researcher at the MICAP project (Media, Information Consumption, and Politics) financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation. I received the Ph.D. in Political and Social Sciences from the European University Institute under the supervision of Professor Alexander H. Trechsel. Formerly I was visiting Junior Scholar at Nuffield College, Oxford University, and Fulbright-Schuman visiting scholar at New York University. I obtained an M.Sc. in Economic and Social Sciences at Bocconi University and an M.Sc. in Comparative and European Politics at the University of Siena.

My research lies at the intersection of political methodology and comparative political behavior. Some of my current projects involve: using Bayesian ideal point estimation to model voters' perceptual bias; using Finite Mixture Models in electoral research to uncover voters' latent heterogeneity; adapting word scaling techniques to model news transcripts and detect media bias; applying dynamic topic modelling to study the evolution of political discourse of parties and movements; using psychometrics algorithms to generate fully-automated Voting Advice Applications.

In my dissertation, titled *Bridging Troubled Water: Electoral Availability in European Party Systems in the Aftermath of the Great Recession*, I develop a hierarchical Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey scaling algorithm to estimate the latent positions of voters and parties in 27 EU countries on two dimensions tapping the left-right position and the position towards the EU. I then use these measures to show that electoral competition in contemporary Europe is no longer structured along the traditional class cleavage. Contemporary political confrontation is structured along the two blocks of mainstream and challenger parties divided on the new integration/demarcation cleavage.
