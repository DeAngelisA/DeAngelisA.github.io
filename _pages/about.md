I am a political scientist focusing on public opinion, digital democracy and computational methods. 
I am currently Assistant Professor (Tenure Track) in Computational Social and Political Sciences at the University of Milan - La Statale. I am also Research Associate at the Department of Political Science of the University of Zurich.
Previously, I was senior researcher and lecturer at the University of Lucerne. 
I received the Ph.D. in Political and Social Sciences from the European University Institute and I have been visiting Junior Scholar at Nuffield College, Oxford University, and Fulbright-Schuman visiting scholar at New York University. 
I am also member of the [Digital Society Initiative](https://democracy.dsi.uzh.ch), co-initiator of the Lucerne Master in Computational Social Science, [LUMACSS](https://www.unilu.ch/en/study/study-programmes/masters-degrees/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/lucerne-master-in-computational-social-sciences-lumacss/) and Editor at [Frontiers in Political Science](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/892213/overview) and [Politics and Governance](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/about/editorialTeam). 

My research moved from public opinion and comparative political behavior into digital democracy and computational methods for social research. My work was published on *Comparative political Studies*, *Political Communication*, and *West European Politics* among other outlets. Links and pre-prints of my contributions are available in the [Publications](https://deangelisa.github.io/publications/) section. 
My work on the long-term dynamics in comparative political behavior with Diego Garzia and Frederico Ferreira da Silva is titled "Leaders without Partisans: Dealignment, Media Change, and the Personalization of Politics" and is available from ECPR Press / Rowman & Littlefield. 
I have also edited a special issue titled "Political Misinformation in the Digital Age during a Pandemic: Partisanship, Propaganda, and Democratic Decision-making" at Frontiers in Political Science. All papers are open access the resulting e-book is available [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/16048/political-misinformation-in-the-digital-age-during-a-pandemic-partisanship-propaganda-and-democratic).

y research has evolved from exploring public opinion and comparative political behavior to focusing on digital democracy, political misinformation, and the use of computational methods in social research. I investigate key questions such as: How do misinformation and algorithms shape public opinion? How can digital tools enhance democratic participation and political accountability?

I am a [certified RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) instructor and passionate teacher in statistics, quantitative research methods, and computational social science techniques. The courses I teach are listed in the [Teaching](https://deangelisa.github.io/teaching/) section. 
I am happy to share teaching materials upon request.
