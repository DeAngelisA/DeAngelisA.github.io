I am a political scientist focusing on public opinion, political behavior, and communication. 
I am currently [SNF Ambizione](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/201817) Fellow with the project "Political Misinformation in the Digital Age" at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/institut/mitarbeitende/staff/adeangelis.html) of the University of Zurich.
Previously, I was senior researcher and lecturer at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/staff/andrea-de-angelis-msc/). 
I received the Ph.D. in Political and Social Sciences from the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/home) and I have been visiting Junior Scholar at Nuffield College, Oxford University, and Fulbright-Schuman visiting scholar at New York University. I am also member of the [Digital Society Initiative](https://democracy.dsi.uzh.ch), co-initiator of the Lucerne Master in Computational Social Science, [LUMACSS](https://www.unilu.ch/en/study/study-programmes/masters-degrees/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/lucerne-master-in-computational-social-sciences-lumacss/) and editor at [Frontiers in Political Science](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/892213/overview) and [Politics and Governance](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/about/editorialTeam). 

My research was published on *Comparative political Studies*, *Political Communication*, and *West European Politics* among other outlets. Links and pre-prints of my contributions are available in the [Publications](https://deangelisa.github.io/publications/) section. 
My work on the long-term dynamics in comparative political behavior with Diego Garzia and Frederico Ferreira da Silva is titled "Leaders without Partisans: Dealignment, Media Change, and the Personalization of Politics" and is available from ECPR Press / Rowman & Littlefield. 
I have also recently edited a special issue titled "Political Misinformation in the Digital Age during a Pandemic: Partisanship, Propaganda, and Democratic Decision-making" at Frontiers in Political Science. All papers are open access the resulting e-book is available [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/16048/political-misinformation-in-the-digital-age-during-a-pandemic-partisanship-propaganda-and-democratic).

I am a [certified RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) instructor and passionate teacher in statistics, quantitative research methods, and computational social science techniques. The courses I teach are listed in the [Teaching](https://deangelisa.github.io/teaching/) section. 
I am happy to share teaching materials upon request.
