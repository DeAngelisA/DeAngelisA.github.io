I am senior researcher and lecturer in political science at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/staff/andrea-de-angelis-msc/). I received my PhD in Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/). Formerly I was visiting Junior Scholar at Nuffield College, Oxford, and Fulbright-Schuman visiting scholar at New York University. I also obtained a M.Sc. in Economic and Social Sciences at Bocconi University and a M.Sc. in Comparative and European Politics at University of Siena.

My research lies at the intersection of political methodology and comparative political behavior. Some of my current projects involve: using Bayesian ideal point estimation to model voters' perceptual bias; using Finite Mixture Models in electoral research to uncover voters' latent heterogeneity; adapting word scaling techniques to model news transcripts and detect media bias; applying dynamic topic modelling to study the evolution of political discourse of parties and movements; using psychometrics algorithms to generate fully-automated Voting Advice Applications.

In my dissertation, titled *Bridging Troubled Water: Electoral Availability in European Party Systems in the Aftermath of the Great Recession*, I develop a hierarchical Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey scaling algorithm to estimate the latent positions of voters and parties in 27 EU countries on two dimensions tapping the left-right position and the position towards the EU. I then use these measures to show that electoral competition in contemporary Europe is no longer structured along the traditional class cleavage. Contemporary political confrontation is structured along the two blocks of mainstream and challenger parties divided on the new integration/demarcation cleavage.
