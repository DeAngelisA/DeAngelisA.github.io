My research investigates how digital media, algorithms, and information environments reshape political judgment, electoral behaviour, and democratic accountability. I combine surveys, experiments, computational methods, and large-scale digital trace data.

### Political Misinformation & Digital Vulnerability
I study why citizens believe or reject political misinformation, how motivated reasoning works in digital environments, and how media literacy interventions can improve information discernment.

## Political Misinformation & Digital Vulnerability {#political-misinformation-digital-vulnerability}

This research program investigates how people encounter, evaluate, and sometimes embrace political misinformation in digital spaces. I focus on the cognitive and motivational mechanisms behind misinformation vulnerability, and on interventions that can foster more reliable news use.

## Media, Media Systems and Public Opinion {#media-media-systems-and-public-opinion}

In this program I study how citizens navigate increasingly personalized and fragmented media systems. I focus on the psychology of opinion formation, as well as the role of algorithmic news feeds, cross-platform exposure, and the consequences of these environments for political learning, trust, and participation.
