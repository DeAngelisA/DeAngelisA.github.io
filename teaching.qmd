title: "Teaching"
---

I teach statistics, causal inference, and computational social science with a strong focus on **hands-on coding**, **reproducible research**, and **independent problem-solving**. My goal is to train students who are not just users of methods, but critical and autonomous empirical researchers.

I have designed and taught more than **40 courses and workshops** across the University of Milan, University of Zurich, and University of Lucerne. In 2022, I received an **Honorary Mention for Excellence in Teaching** from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences (University of Lucerne).

My teaching practice is grounded in evidence-based pedagogy for computational learning, with a strong emphasis on live coding, formative assessment, collaborative problem-solving, and inclusive classroom design. I also hold the **official RStudio tidyverse Instructor Certification**.

## Teaching Philosophy

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
I treat coding as a **research instrument**. Students learn by replicating real studies, building their own datasets, and developing projects that are fully reproducible from raw data to final paper.

My courses are designed to minimize passive learning, maximize structured trial-and-error, and progressively shift students from guided execution to independent problem formulation.
:::

Key principles that guide my teaching:

- **Learning-by-doing** through live coding and replication  
- **Reproducibility-first** (version control, transparent workflows)  
- **Error literacy**: making mistakes visible and productive  
- **Substantive anchoring**: methods always tied to real political questions
