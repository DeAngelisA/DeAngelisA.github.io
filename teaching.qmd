I have designed and taught a total of **44 courses**, including lectures, seminars, and workshops in computational social sciences, statistics, and political communication.

In 2022, I received an **honorary mention for teaching excellence** from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Lucerne.

## Teaching Philosophy
I emphasize **hands-on coding**, **reproducible workflows**, and **critical thinking**. My goal is to empower students to not only understand statistical concepts but to apply them independently to answer substantive social science questions.
