<h2>Supervision Opportunities for Master’s Students</h2>

I welcome motivated students interested in cutting-edge research topics in political communication, computational social sciences, and digital democracy. I am particularly open to supervising work on the following topics:

- Designing media literacy tips to prevent misinformation acceptance.  
- Mechanisms of microtargeting in political ads on social media platforms.  
- Using Generative Pre-Trained Large Language Models (LLMs/LMMs) as generalizable experimental treatments.  
- The restructuring of political conflicts in the digital age.  
- Latent variable modeling for reducing measurement bias in multidimensional concepts.
