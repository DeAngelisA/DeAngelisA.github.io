I will push you to sharpen your theory, strengthen your design, and aim for a level of quality that matches your full potential.\n\n\nI provide detailed feedback on substance, logic, and empirical analysis. I am not an English-language editor: I will correct language on a sample, but you are expected to apply the same standards to the full manuscript.\n\n\nExpect to write at least two full drafts:\n\nFirst draft – written to think: explores ideas, identifies weaknesses, builds structure.\n\nSecond draft – written to communicate: structured, precise, audience-oriented."
