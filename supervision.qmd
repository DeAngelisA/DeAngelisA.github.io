## What to Expect

### My Role
I will support you in becoming an independent and critical thinker. I am open and supportive, but also demanding. Expect me to challenge you to deliver a paper that matches your full potential.

### Writing
I am not an English teacher, but I will provide detailed feedback on substance, arguments, and empirics. For grammar, I will provide comments on a sample, but you are expected to apply them to the full draft.

### Drafting
Expect to write **at least two drafts**.
1.  **First Draft**: Written to *think*. Forges arguments and explores ideas.
2.  **Second Draft**: Written to *communicate*. Polished, structured, and audience-focused.

## Policy on LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
LLMs can be excellent tools for refining thinking and improving writing, but they must **enhance, not replace** your own analytical thinking.
**Important**: Any misuse of LLMs (e.g., generating entire sections without critical engagement) will be considered academic misconduct. I use LLMs in my own research and can spot their output.
