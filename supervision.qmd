title: "Supervision"
---

I supervise Master’s and PhD theses in **digital media**, **political behaviour**, and **computational social science**. I work best with students who are intellectually curious, methodologically ambitious, and motivated to build research projects that combine strong theory with transparent empirical analysis.

I particularly welcome students interested in the transformation of political communication, digital democracy, and the use of computational and experimental methods in political research.

---

## Topics of Interest

I am especially open to supervising projects on:

- Designing and testing **media literacy interventions** to reduce misinformation vulnerability  
- The mechanisms and effects of **political microtargeting** on social media  
- Using **Generative AI and Large Language Models** as experimental treatments  
- The restructuring of **political conflict and ideological alignment** in digital environments  
- **Latent variable modeling** and measurement strategies to reduce bias  

Interdisciplinary projects that combine political science with data science, psychology, or communication studies are particularly encouraged.

## What to Expect

::: {.panel-tabset}

### My Role
My goal is to help you become an **independent and critical researcher**. I am supportive and available, but also demanding. I will push you to sharpen your theory, strengthen your design, and aim for a level of quality that matches your full potential. 

### Writing
I provide detailed feedback on **substance, logic, and empirical analysis**. I am not an English-language editor: I will correct language on a sample, but you are expected to apply the same standards to the full manuscript.

### Drafting
Expect to write **at least two full drafts**:

1. **First draft** – written to *think*: explores ideas, identifies weaknesses, builds structure.  
2. **Second draft** – written to *communicate*: structured, precise, audience-oriented.

## Policy on Generative AI

::: {.callout-warning}
Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) can be useful tools for brainstorming, refining arguments, and improving clarity. However, they must **support—not replace—your own analytical thinking**.

**Important:** Generating substantial parts of a thesis without critical engagement constitutes academic misconduct. I actively use LLMs in my own research and can recognize their unreflective output.
